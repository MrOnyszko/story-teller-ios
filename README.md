# Story teller

This is a playground project to teach myself how to create applications on iOS using Swift and Swift UI.

In the app you can browse stories on the list, you can remove and can add story. 

The story has title and content and many translations. The translation is done using HTTP request to Ollama which is locally installed on the computer. It is just for the sake of making HTTP requests.

The stories are stored in the Core Data using Swift Data.

There are some unit tests which uses MockSwift and Sourcery for mocking.
